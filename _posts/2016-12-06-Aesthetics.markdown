Eye-Robot was designed to be cute. A large head and constantly surprised-looking mouth make the robot easy to interact with. Custom curved pieces of spring lasercut plywood make the corners and head of the robot rounded, breaking from the boxy look of robots past and giving eye-robot a cartoonish feel.The overall size of the robot was chosen to enable interaction with people who are sitting down without being large and threatening. Our team logo is rastered into the side.
